		<div class="courseTitle">Game Theory for Survival</div>
		<div>14 Jun, 21 Jun, 28 Jun</div>
		<div>Matteo Tabaro, Hannah Tillman-Morris</div>
	</div>
	<p>What do chess and ecology have in common? They are both games! For example, foxes and hares are some of the oldest and most experienced players of survival games. Is there a chance for these two species to harmoniously coexist? What type of equilibria can be achieved? Does the survival of one species result in the extinction of the other? How does rock-paper scissors help us understand foxes and hares? Instead of tackling such problems directly, we will first take a detour into game theory and learn about the solutions to famous problems such as the prisoner’s dilemma, before applying such techniques to help us delve into ecology and survivability models.</p>

		<div class="courseTitle">Voting Theory</div>
		<div>3 Mar, 10 Mar, 17 Mar</div>
		<div>Angela Wu, Emilio McAllister Fognini</div>
	</div>
	<p>Whatever your political leanings, it’s important to vote! But how is an individual vote counted? This module is on voting theory: the mathematics of how to design a fair election. We’ll explore different voting systems and how they compare. Is one more fair than another? What does more fair even mean? We will try to answer these questions and more. And if we have time, we’ll prove mathematically that the only true democracy…is a dictatorship!</p>

		<div class="courseTitle">Graph Algorithms: Real-world engineering examples and theory</div>
		<div>2 Mar, 9 Mar, 16 Mar</div>
		<div>Corvin Paul, Kristina Kubiliūtė</div>
	</div>
	<p>Have you ever wondered what happens when you plan a route using your favourite navigation website like Google Maps? After you asked Maps how to get from the British Museum to King’s Cross, a sophisticated algorithm will determine the best route for you. Route planning is one of the prime examples that draws on the ample theory of graph algorithms. A graph is a mathematical abstraction that can model concepts like roads between cities or fibre optic cable networks that connect us all to the internet. In this course we will have a look at some real-world engineering problems such as route planning, and network planning, while also diving into the versatile general theory that can be applied in many contexts. After learning these algorithms, you will be able to think of your own applications. I am looking forward to seeing everyone.</p>

		<div class="courseTitle">Logic for Possibility</div>
		<div>2 Dec, 9 Dec, 16 Dec</div>
		<div>Todd Schmid, Qaasim Shaafi</div>
	</div>
	<p>This course is about a kind of logic that originates in philosophy but is incredibly important to modern computer science: modal logic! The idea behind modal logic is to see truth as a relative property of statements, kind of like a resource that can change over time or from place to place. For example, “It’s raining in London” is not true at the time of writing, but it’s probably going to be true when you read this. For another example, “Water is everywhere” is certainly true on Earth, even though it’s not true on Saturn. This might seem hard to think about mathematically, but trust me: It’ll all make sense by the end of day 2.</p>

	<p>I mentioned before that modal logic has applications in computer science. It also has applications in many other areas, from abstract applications to number theory to the logistics of space travel and even to the social sciences. (We won’t get to look at all of the applications, but we’ll be able to point you in the direction of interesting work once we’re done!) By the end of the course, you will have a better understanding of resource management in space, know a little more about how computers think about programs, and have the tools to model the spread of rumours at school.</p>

		<div class="courseTitle">Heuristic Reasoning and the Art of Problem Solving</div>
		<div>11 Nov, 18 Nov, 25 Nov</div>
		<div>Rehan Shah</div>
	</div>
	<p>Polya’s famous mathematical exposition ‘How to Solve It’ written in 1945 enumerates the following four stages of problem-solving:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Understand the problem</li>
		<li>Devise a plan of attack to solve it</li>
		<li>Execute the plan</li>
		<li>Review your work to evaluate how it could be made better</li>
	</ol>
	<p>He also states that for every difficult problem you can’t solve, there must exist an easier, more accessible related problem that you can solve: find it. While this might seem like elementary, obvious common sense, its utility in solving exciting mathematical problems of varying flavours is paramount and this is exactly what this course aims to demonstrate.</p>
	<p>In this course, we shall explore a selection of interesting conundrums and thought-provoking questions from a wide variety of topics to highlight the beauty, elegance and recreational pleasure they provide. As a skilled problem-solver, you can then employ these techniques of heuristic reasoning to unravel the magic of mathematics.</p>
