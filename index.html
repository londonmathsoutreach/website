	<p color=red>We are sorry to say that sorry to say LMO has effectively gone on hiatus, as most of the PhD students who started it have by now left London or moved on to other things. LMO is a wonderful opportunity for GCSE students to learn higher maths, and we wish it could continue. We thank you for your years of interest, and we hope to be able to offer courses again soon.</p>

	<p color=red>Thankfully, LMO is not the only outreach program for mathematics in London. To see what other outreach opportunities currently running in London, contact Dr. Luciano Rila at l.rila[at]ucl.ac.uk.</p>
	
	<h2>About Us</h2>	
		
	<p>London Maths Outreach offers weekly maths classes for school students from the London area during which students can explore interesting mathematics beyond the standard curriculum. Our teachers are enthusiastic mathematics PhD students from the three universities Imperial College London, Kingâ€™s College London, and University College London. Our advisory board consists of staff from all three universities with extensive experience in mathematics outreach and we also work together with the outreach offices of all three universities.</p>
